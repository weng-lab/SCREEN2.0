  "RAMPAGE (RNA Annotiation and Mapping of Promoters for Analysis of Gene Expression) data allows for the annotation of and expression at transcription start sites with nucleotide precision. Here, we display the sum of signal (from ENCODE Data Coordination Center's RAMPAGE pipeline) in a +-50bp window around GENCODE V19 annotated TSSs for the cRE's nearest protein coding gene. As, this signal is strand specific, we display signal from both the + and - strands for each experiment."
